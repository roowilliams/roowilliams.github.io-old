_[Breakout.js](http://breakoutjs.com/) is a prototyping tool for exploring the intersection of the web and the physical world._

I had some fun (and some frustration) last night trying to get my head around breakout.js. Immense possibility here; the Arduino can be used as an output and also an input to a web page to create tangible interactions with websites.

The music is my ode to this music in this amazing video on using magnets to create physical/tangible interfaces for mobile devices.
