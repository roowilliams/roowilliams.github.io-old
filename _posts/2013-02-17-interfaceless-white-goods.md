Why not give every home appliance a low-powered Bluetooth/WiFi module and do away with interfaces? Less tooling, less material variation, less quality control, interface design costs and more hygienic are among the many benefits that I can think of off the top of my head.

What happens if your smart-phone breaks/gets lost you ask? Well that could be problematic if it is your sole computing device, but do you know anyone without at least one computer in their house that couldn’t provide an interface to these devices?

This might not be the most desirable solution for older generations, but it is definitely time to start rolling out home appliances without interfaces. I’d buy them.
  
Samsung already have a smart washing machine, controllable via app. Hopefully we wont see too many more touch screens, and horrible designs like this bad boy:
