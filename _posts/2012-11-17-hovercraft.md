As a runner up in the final round of a competition to represent TMW at the 2013 South by South West festival in Texas, I was awarded a personal development fund to the value of £250. Not at all shabby! I am going to use the money to fund a new project – an Arduino powered hovercraft.  

The intention is that by doing this project I will hone my making skills, electronic skills, learn about wireless technology, data collection and have built a fun, modular platform that can be controlled via software. I’m planning to strap a few ultrasound sensors to it and see if I can make it autonomous, as well as exploring whether it is possible to map an environment via feedback from these sensors. In future I can add a camera for FPV driving, GPS shield and hopefully an automated Nerf gun launcher. Excited!
