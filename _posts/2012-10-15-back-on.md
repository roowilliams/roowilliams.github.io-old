When I set my sights on going to university over 4 years ago my internal manifesto was to firstly work out what I wanted to do, and then to end up finding a job that I loved so much, it no longer felt like the negative notion of ‘work’ we have all come to know.

And since graduating, I have been lucky enough to do exactly that. Having recently been hired as [TMW](http://www.tmw.co.uk)‘s first Product Designer in their Technical Innovation Hub. I have been given the remit to explore the boundaries between digital and physical and develop creative and technically angled solutions for clients and future business. Oh, and make stuff. Dream job.

It’s only my third week, but I will be keeping a blog of my ongoing projects, so I want to use this post as a marker and an intro to new subject matter.
