Whilst being blessed with the ability to get excited about aesthetics and also the ability to get excited about technology, it is easy to neglect one area in favour of another from time to time. Currently I have been pushing hard on the tech side of things, learning to swim in a deep pool of electronics and code.
So when I make some time to check my favourite design blogs, it’s as if being absent from the consumption of lovely aesthetics for a while makes getting back into it much more enjoyable!

A few cool things:

Valhalla from Sweetgrass Productions is a new snowboarding/ski film with a gorgeous aesthetic. The saturated, grainy imagery pushes the cross-processed trend far into psychedelia. Just by watching the trailer it seems the delivery is so rich and immersive, it causes me to feel a certain way.

It is amazing how far these films have progressed. No longer are we seeing rough edits shot by a camera man with one eye on the action and the other eye on where he’s going, these films are feature-length, sit down, grab some popcorn and have your mind blown, projector-worthy pieces of art.

[Designspiration.net](http://www.designspiration.net) is filled with bang-on visual trends as usual. Loving the emphasis on hand-drawn typography, truth to materials in interior design and minimal logotypes harking back to the days of old.

I am wondering if the emergence of this vintage, minimal aesthetic stems from a backlash to the ultra-slick, corporate design of web 2.0. Somehow it almost feels anti-corporate in its content, despite the following logotypes advertising businesses, the letterforms, and scratchyness hints at a time where companies were more human, honestly struggling along trying to make some money.

If you gave a thought about how a the premises of business with this style of logo might look you’d be forgiven for expecting it to have a similar aesthetic to this:

There’s definitely an organic, human, minimal and vintage theme here. Furnishings, construction and objects that are honest and true to the materials used (as in not hidden or covered by some horrible plastic veneer.) Although this is actually probably someones home, it represents the same theme we are seeing within visual culture at the moment.

I like it.
