<h1 class="section-title">Andrew ‘Roo’ Williams</h1>

<p class="tagline">I solve problems, and these are the skills I have to do that. I am particularly emotionally invested in the following areas:</p>

<p class="tagline">I am a product designer working at the intersection of physical and digital, exploring what can be possible with new technologies.</p>
<p class="tagline">I currently work at <a href="http://wwww.tmwunlimited.com" target="_blank">TMW Unlimited</a> where I am Lab Tech Lead.</p>


<!-- I am Andrew Williams. I like making things, casual anthropology, design, aesthetics, music and constantly learning. I love the Internet and (some of) the culture that has emerged out of it and I have built websites since I was a kid. I studied Product Design at Central Saint Martins, London and now I create real-world stuff that also has a presence in the digital world...

Through the process of making physical/digital prototypes and products I have learned a lot about a lot.
I like to think and imagine new possiblities and I write down a lot of these thoughts here.

I'm competative, brazen and exert boundless enthusiasm. I struggle to sleep past 8am, even on a Sunday because I am genuinely excited by life. I care a lot for the natural world and I've always got time for fun. -->
