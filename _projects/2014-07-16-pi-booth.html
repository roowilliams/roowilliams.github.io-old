tagline: "A Raspberry Pi powered photobooth controlled via your smartphone."
description: "On a new employees first day at TMW the receptionists take a photo that will serve as an avatar attached to every email you send and every intranet post you make for the rest of your days at the agency. The problem is that on your first day nerves are on edge and the TMW receptionists, as lovely as they are, aren't professional photographers. Our head of operations asked me if this could be improved and the result was a connected photobooth controlled entirely via the user's smartphone."

The whole thing runs on a Raspberry Pi. A Python-based webserver called Flask combined with Flask-Socketio is used to provide a web interface and controller. Using the GPIO pins to control a relay I was able to create a timed flash. The unit was designed and built to be fabricated using digital manufacturing technology - laser cut and 3D printed.

By removing the stock lens from the Raspberry Pi's camera module then designing and 3D printing an adaptor I created a way to exchange lenses giving the booth a greater field of view.

It was an opportunity to test a novel way to interface with physical products. The booth is controlled entirely through a smartphone, via a website. There is something quite magical about pressing a digital button and having a physical thing happen. This also created an inspiration/talking point for our clients, eg. could people interact with an installation in a shop window via their phones?
