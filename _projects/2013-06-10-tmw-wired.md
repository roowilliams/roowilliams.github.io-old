In 2013 TMW packed up shop on the King's Road, Chelsea and shipped over to a brand new Soho premesis.
We wanted to show our new home off to our clients by throwing a house-warming party. We also thought it'd be a good opportunity to show off some of the tech we'd been playing with in the form of a connected giant steady hand game.

We initially sent an email invite out to our clients that asked them to RSVP with their Twitter handle. Once we had their Twitter handle we linked each attendee to a RFID bracelet.</p>

On the evening of the party each attendee was given their wristband. Tapping this wristband against an RFID reader mounted on the game let the system know who was playing.

The user's progress around the course was tracked using a webcam which scrubbed through a video tour of our new office on a projected image alongside the game. It quickly became apparent that people weren't bothered by the video and it was all about watching the person playing the game!

On touching the loop the user was subjected to a blast from a klaxon horn which coupled with a vibration in the loop handle produced a jarring effect that actually felt like an electric shock.

At that same moment a webcam took a photo of the shock and it got tweeted by the game. Or so that was the intention, unfortunately whilst setting up someone bumped into the game and broke our webcam capabilities!

But that didn't stop the game from working, and goes to show that you don't always need clever tech to have fun.

I was tasked with the complete hardware design and build. I learned how to cut, bend and solder copper pipe so if you ever need some plumbing... it's probably best to call someone else.

The installation was modular and easy to break down and move around. It lived in the basement for a few months before we reincarnated it
