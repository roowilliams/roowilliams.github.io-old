A freelance project for M&C Saatchi. While pitching for Virgin Holiday's account they asked me to create a 'Virgin World' to help them communicate their vision; whisked away from the mundane to an intense, hi-def, hyper-real experience full of mojo.

The brief was forever changing until at the last minute they settled on this idea of a Virgin brand world.

The box walls were held using magnets and a lid kept it together. Many props emerged from the box during the pitch. The big reveal happened when the sides were hit, causing the front and back to fall revealing the hovering Virgin world.

Built over a weekend, and also whilst interning at another agency!  
With help from [William Mazuch](http://wmazu.ch/).
