The data displayed on a large screen near the device updates instantly providing a satisfying moment for the user, no matter how they're feeling. Each press is collected along with the time, date and weather information into a SQL database.

TMW strives to be in the top ten list of places to work survey. The presence of this device speaks about TMW's attitude to its employees happiness.

I initally experimented with RFID as a way to get a much richer dataset, the RFID tags providing the ability to track individual cards but experienced inconsistent results with RFID signal strength and the card readers we were using. Read more about that in THIS blog post.

One of the most interesting parts of this project is the user behaviour that emerged. Results are easily skewed by constantly tapping on one of the options and some people like to game the system. Then there are users that like to game the opposite way resulting in a statistical tug-of-war. When the Data department conducted their analysis to tease out some stories we had to strip out the taps that came in within 2 seconds of each other.

Paper prototypes allowed me to understand how people might use the proposed Sentimeter and what emotions they might like to show. After some discussion the decision was made to only include two options to force people to polarise and think about how they felt.
