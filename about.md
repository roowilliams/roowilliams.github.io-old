<h1 class="section-title">Andrew ‘Roo’ Williams</h1>


<p class="tagline">I solve problems, and these are the skills I have to do that. I am particularly emotionally invested in the following areas:</p>

I get excited about most things but to narrow it down I like making things, casual anthropology, design, music and learning. I studied Product Design at Central Saint Martins, London, taught myself to code and think the Internet is amazing.  
Now I strive to create meaningful products that leverage the possibilities unlocked by a networked world.

I'd love to do projects in the following areas:

- Conservation
- Recycling
- Interfaceless
- Animal welfare


I currently work at <a href="http://wwww.tmwunlimited.com" target="_blank">TMW Unlimited</a> where I am Lab Tech Lead.

I'm competative, brazen and exert boundless enthusiasm. I struggle to sleep past 8am, even on a Sunday because I am genuinely excited by life. I care a lot for the natural world and I've always got time for fun.
