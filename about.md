I studied Product Design at Central Saint Martins, London, taught myself to code and think the Internet is amazing. Now I strive to create meaningful products that leverage the possibilities unlocked by a networked world.

I'm an excitable character, chatty, competative, pretty brazen and I like it that way. I love making things, casual anthropology, good design, location-based tech, heavy music and learning. I struggle to sleep past 7am, even on a Sunday, because I am genuinely excited by life. If I’m not working on a brief at work, or at home smashing out side projects, I’m reading about stuff, going to exhibitions, events, gigs, cycling with friends. I also organise a hardware meetup here in London.

I am currently Lab Tech Lead at <a href="http://www.tmwunlimited.com" target="_blank">TMW Unlimited</a>, where I spend my days prototyping, experimenting and building things using emerging tech.
