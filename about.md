<h1 class="section-title">Roo Williams</h1>


<p class="tagline">I love to solve problems.</p>

<img src="/assets/images/roowilliams.jpg" />

I studied Product Design at Central Saint Martins, London, taught myself to code and think the Internet is amazing.  
Now I strive to create meaningful products that leverage the possibilities unlocked by a networked world.

I’m a chatty guy, inherently competitive, kinda brazen and exert boundless enthusiasm. I give things my all.

I get excited about most things. I like it that way, but to narrow it down, I love making things, casual anthropology, good design, location-based tech, heavy music and learning. I also like fixing things and feeding my brain.

I struggle to sleep past 7am, even on a Sunday, because I am genuinely excited by life. If I’m not working on a brief at work, or at home nailing side projects, I’m reading about stuff, going to exhibitions, events, gigs, cycling with friends. I also organise a hardware meetup here in London.

I currently work at <a href="http://wwww.tmwunlimited.com" target="_blank">TMW Unlimited</a> where I am Lab Tech Lead; prototyping, experimenting and building things using emerging tech.
